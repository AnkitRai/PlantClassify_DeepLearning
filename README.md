# Identifying tree species using deep learning
Recognizing tree species using convolutional neural network
 The project aims at classifying tree species using (leaf RGB images) convolutional neural network with different architecture.
 
 The data used - 
"Leafsnap: A Computer Vision System for Automatic Plant Species Identification," Neeraj Kumar, Peter N. Belhumeur, Arijit Biswas, David W. Jacobs, W. John Kress, Ida C. Lopez, Jo√£o V. B. Soares, Proceedings of the 12th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV),October 2012

Since, the model is trained on ~10K images, we could achieve ~ 73% accuracy.

P.S. Next, would train using Tensorflow API.
